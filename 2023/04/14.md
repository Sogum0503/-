```sql
SELECT COUNT(CASE WHEN DAYNAME(submit_date) IN ('Sunday','Saturday') THEN task_id END) AS weekend_cnt, # 해당되는 요일의 이름을 출력 
       COUNT(CASE WHEN WEEKDAY(submit_date) BETWEEN 0 AND 4 THEN task_id END) AS working_cnt # 해당되는 요일을 0~6으로 리턴

SELECT SUM(weekend) AS weekend_cnt,
       SUM(weekday) AS working_cnt
FROM (SELECT IF(WEEKDAY(submit_date) > 4, 1, 0) AS weekend,
             IF(WEEKDAY(submit_date) < 5, 1, 0) AS weekday
      FROM Tasks) A
