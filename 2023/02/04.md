### 첫 주문과 마지막 주문
```sql
SELECT DATE_FORMAT(MIN(order_purchase_timestamp),'%Y-%m-%d') AS first_order_date,
      DATE_FORMAT(MAX(order_purchase_timestamp),'%Y-%m-%d') AS last_order_date
FROM olist_orders_dataset 
```
### 배송 예정일 예측 성공과 실패
```sql
SELECT DATE(order_purchase_timestamp) AS purchase_date,
      COUNT(DISTINCT CASE WHEN order_estimated_delivery_date > order_delivered_customer_date THEN order_id END) AS success,
      COUNT(DISTINCT CASE WHEN order_estimated_delivery_date <= order_delivered_customer_date THEN order_id END) AS fail 
FROM olist_orders_dataset
WHERE DATE(order_purchase_timestamp) >= '2017-01-01'
AND DATE(order_purchase_timestamp) <= '2017-01-31'
AND order_delivered_customer_date IS NOT NULL 
AND order_estimated_delivery_date IS NOT NULL
GROUP BY purchase_date 
ORDER BY purchase_date ASC
```
