### 571. Find Median Given Frequency of Numbers
```sql

# numbers의 중앙값을 출력하시오. 
# 중앙값은 소숫점 첫번째 자리 까지 표현합니다. 

WITH temp AS(
    SELECT *,
            SUM(frequency) OVER(ORDER BY num ASC) AS accumulated_sum,
            SUM(frequency) OVER()/2 AS medium_num
    FROM Numbers 
)

SELECT ROUND(AVG(num*1.0),2) AS median
FROM temp 
WHERE accumulated_sum - frequency <= medium_num
AND accumulated_sum >= medium_num 
	# The accumulated frequency of the previous num should be smaller or equal to medium_num
  
```
