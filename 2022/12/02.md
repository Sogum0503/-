### leetcode
#### 597. Friend Requests I: Overall Acceptance Rate
*  to find the overall acceptance rate of requests, which is the number of acceptance divided by the number of requests. 
*  Return the answer rounded to 2 decimals places.
```sql
SELECT(
	IFNULL(
    	ROUND(
        	(SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT requester_id, accepter_id) FROM RequestAccepted)/
                (SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT sender_id, send_to_id) FROM FriendRequest)
              ,2)
        ,0)
 ) AS accept_rate
```
문제 풀이
```
sender가 동일한 수신자에게 여러번 요청을 보낼 수 있고, 요청이 두 번 이상 수락될 수 있기 때문에 DISTINCT하게 sender_id, send_to_id를 COUNT해야함 -- requester/accepter도 동일
소수점 이하 두자리 까지 반올림 -> round,2 
request가 전혀 없으면 accept_rate를 0으로 반환 -> ifnull 
```

#### 603. Consecutive Available Seats
* to report all the consecutive available seats in the cinema.
* Return the result table ordered by seat_id in ascending order.
* The test cases are generated so that more than two seats are consecutively available.

with re_cinema as (
    select *,
    sum(free) over (order by seat_id range between 1 preceding and 1 following) as total
    from cinema
    where free = 1
)
select seat_id
from re_cinema
where total >= 2
```
