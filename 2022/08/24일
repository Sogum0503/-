[571#_HARD] Find Median Given Frequency of Numbers

문제풀이

sum(frequency)/2 = median 위치 
sum(frequency) over(order by num asc) = 누적합


# avg(num)을 하는 이유? 

# cnt%2 = 0일때
median_point = cnt/2 혹은 (cnt/2)+1 <- 이 연산을 위해 

# cnt%2 != 0 일때
median_point = round(cnt/2)

[1,1,1,2,2,2]

num freq accumulated_sum m_index
1    3         3           3,4
2    3         6           3,4

# 최종 쿼리
with temp as (
    select *,
            sum(frequency) over (order by num asc) as accumulated_sum,
            sum(frequency) over() / 2 as m_index
    from numbers)

select round(avg(num*1.0),2) as median
from temp
where accumulated_sum - frequency <= m_index
and accumulated_sum >= m_index
